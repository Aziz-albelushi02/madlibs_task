## Setup

### New Directory

1. Go into the `Development` directory using `cd`.
2. Create a new directory called `python` using `mkdir`.

## Fork & Clone

1. Fork [this repository](https://github.com/JoinCODED/madlibs), which means making a copy of the repository under your account. You can do this by clicking the button on the top-right corner of the page that says "Fork". The button looks like this:

2. Activate the GitHub Actions by going to the Actions tab and clicking the big green button.

3. Go back to the main repository page by clicking the Code tab on the top-left corner.

4. Click the green button on the right that says "Clone or download," then copy the URL in the popup by clicking the copy button to the right of the URL.

5. In your `python`, directory you just made, clone this repository with this command: `git clone PASTE_URL_HERE`. In the example above, the command would be `git clone https://github.com/msharydemo/madlibs.git`

You'll do all the previous steps in every task from now on all throughout the bootcamp.

Once you clone it, you'll see a new directory inside your `python` directory named "madlibs". This is the git repository you just cloned. Inside you'll find a file named "madlibs.py." This is where you'll be writing the code for this task. You can ignore all the other files inside.

In "madlibs.py", you'll find an empty function called `main()`. Write all your code for this task inside this function.

## Task

In this task, the user should be given a story with gaps that the user should fill to complete the story. So basically a game of mad libs.

Example:

```
Mad libs where libs get mad.
Start below:

Enter a number from 1 to 12: 6
Enter a noun (plural): dolls
Enter a name: stephen sedoll
Enter any sentence: the future is made of dolls
Enter a verb: shake my head

The story goes...

It was 6 o'clock when I heard a knock at the door.
I opened the door and there was a box full of dolls with a note saying "From Mr. Stephen Sedoll."
Just as I closed the door I heard a scream "THE FUTURE IS MADE OF DOLLS."
I froze in place and all I could do was shake my head.
```

The user enters the number `6`, the plural noun `dolls`, the name `stephen sedoll`, the sentence `the future is made of dolls`, and the verb `shake my head`. Then the story at the end is generated automatically based on the user's input.

### Task Steps

- Use the story in the example above for the user to complete. The values that need to be filled by the user's input are:
  - `time`
  - `items`
  - `name`: When printing the name to the user, the first letter of each word should be capitalized. See the example above.
  - `scream`: When printing the scream to the user, all the letters in the scream have to be capitalized. See the example above.
  - `action`
- Add the file `madlibs.py` to the git repository, commit changes, and push your code to the remote repository.

Hint: You will need [string methods](https://www.w3schools.com/python/python_ref_string.asp).
